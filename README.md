# Basketball game (created with OpenGL)

## Overview

This game is a project done in Ecole Polytechnique, proposed in the course 
INF443: Informatique graphique 3D. It is a very simple basketball game written 
in C++ using OpenGL as API in order to create 3D scenes. This project is
done in collaboration with my classmate, Cl√©ment Barbier.

## Prerequisite
Library **GLFW3**: https://www.glfw.org/

On linux, run `sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev`.

## Compilation

Let us suppose you have a command line opened in the root repository.
```
$ cd cmake
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ cd ../..
$ cmake/build/pgm
```
(note: the build directory is temporary and can be removed safely)
