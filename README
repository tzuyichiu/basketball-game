= Reminder to compile using compiling tools in Linux

Let us suppose you have a command line opened in the directory 01_minimal_window/

== Using CMake (in command line)

$ cd cmake
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ cd ../..
$ cmake/build/pgm

(note: the build directory is temporary and can be removed safely)


== Using CMake (with QtCreator)

$ qtcreator cmake/CMakeLists.txt &

Then follow the configuration steps from the GUI.

By default, a temporary directory build-cmake-Desktop-Default is created (in the parent directory of CMakeLists.txt file), as well as a file CMakeLists.txt.user (same directory than CMakeLists.txt file). Both can be removed safely.


= On Windows system

- Use CMakeLists.txt with Visual Studio
- Precompiled version of GLFW3 is provided (precompiled/glfw3_win) with win32
- You need to copy data/ and shaders/ directories in the executable directory
